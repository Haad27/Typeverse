 Project Title: Typeverse
 Final Semester Project ‚Äì Computer Science
Using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and GUI

 Project Overview:
Typeverse is a typing speed and accuracy testing application, developed as a final semester project for the Computer Science program. It functions similarly to the well-known platform MonkeyType, offering users a way to measure and improve their typing performance through an interactive interface.

The key focus of this project is on implementing Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and building a clean, responsive Graphical User Interface (GUI). Rather than using advanced topics like Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Typeverse emphasizes fundamental software design, usability, and modular code structure.

 Objectives:
Demonstrate practical application of OOP principles such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

Build a fully functional GUI application for typing tests using tools such as C++ with Qt, Python with Tkinter or PyQt, or Java with JavaFX/Swing (based on selected language).

Deliver a user-friendly environment to practice typing and track performance.

 Core Features:
Typing Modes:

Time-based (e.g., 30s, 60s)

Word-count-based (e.g., 25 or 50 words)

Live Metrics Display:

Words Per Minute (WPM)

Accuracy percentage

Mistyped characters

GUI Interface:

Clean, distraction-free layout

Start/Reset buttons, word boxes, live stats area

Keyboard focus and error-highlighting

Code Organization:

Separate classes for Word Generator, Timer, Typing Engine, Statistics Manager, etc.

MVC-like architecture (optional) for better separation of logic and GUI

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies:
Programming Language: C++, Java, or Python

OOP: Core implementation focus

GUI Library (depending on language):

C++: Qt

Python: Tkinter / PyQt

Java: JavaFX / Swing

 Project Scope:
This project does not involve complex algorithms, data structures, or database systems. Instead, the scope is well-defined around implementing GUI-based features using OOP fundamentals, making it ideal for demonstrating core programming and software design skills.

 Learning Outcomes:
Hands-on experience with OOP in a real-world scenario

Building GUI-based applications from scratch

Understanding how modular, class-based design improves code maintenance and scalability

Gaining confidence in delivering a complete desktop application
